# The FastPFOR C++ library : Fast integer compression
![Ubuntu-CI](https://github.com/lemire/FastPFor/workflows/Ubuntu-CI/badge.svg)


## What is this?

A research library with integer compression schemes.
It is broadly applicable to the compression of arrays of
32-bit integers where most integers are small.
The library seeks to exploit SIMD instructions (SSE)
whenever possible.

This library can decode at least 4 billions of compressed integers per second on most x64
desktop or laptop processors. That is, it can decompress data at a rate of 15 GB/s.
This is significantly faster than generic codecs like gzip, LZO, Snappy or LZ4.

It is used by the [zsearch engine](http://victorparmar.github.com/zsearch/)
as well as in [GMAP and GSNAP](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/). DuckDB derived some of their code from this library It
has [been ported to Java](https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR),
[C#](https://github.com/Genbox/CSharpFastPFOR)  and 
[Go](https://github.com/reducedb/encoding). The Java port is used by
[ClueWeb Tools](https://github.com/lintool/clueweb).

[Apache Lucene version 4.6.x uses a compression format derived from our FastPFOR
scheme](http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_6_1/core/org/apache/lucene/util/PForDeltaDocIdSet.html).

## Python bindings

## Myths

Myth: SIMD compression requires very large blocks of integers (1024 or more).

Fact: This is not true. Our fastest scheme (SIMDBinaryPacking) works over blocks of 128 integers.
[Another very fast scheme (Stream VByte) works over blocks of four integers](https://github.com/lemire/streamvbyte).

Myth: SIMD compression means high speed but less compression.

Fact: This is wrong. Some schemes cannot easily be accelerated
with SIMD instructions, but many that do compress very well.

## Security

It is a low-level library. The inputs are not validated prior to decoding. It is assumed that the provided buffers were generated 
by the corresponding encoding functions. It is your responsibility to ensure the validity of your data. In production systems,
the use a strong hashing function to check for data integrity is recommended. The library does not provide this functionality.

## Working with sorted lists of integers

If you are working primarily with sorted lists of integers, then 
you might want to use differential coding. That is you may want to
compress the deltas instead of the integers themselves. The current 
library (fastpfor) is generic and was not optimized for this purpose.
However, we have another library designed to compress sorted integer
lists: 

https://github.com/lemire/SIMDCompressionAndIntersection

This other library (SIMDCompressionAndIntersection) also comes complete
with new SIMD-based intersection algorithms.

There is also a C library for differential coding (fast computation of
deltas, and recovery from deltas):

## License

This code is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0 (ASL2.0).

## Software Requirements

This code requires a compiler supporting C++11. This was
a design decision.

It builds under 

*  clang++ 3.2 (LLVM 3.2) or better,
*  Intel icpc (ICC) 13.0.1 or better,
*  MinGW32 (x64-4.8.1-posix-seh-rev5)
*  Microsoft VS 2012 or better,
* and GNU GCC 4.7 or better.

The code was tested under Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Hardware Requirements

On an x64 platform, your processor should support SSSE3. This includes almost every Intel or AMD processor
sold after 2006. (Note: the key schemes require merely SSE2.)  Some specific binaries will only run if your processor 
supports SSE4.1. They have been purely used for specific tests however.

We also support ARM platforms (aarch64 / ARM64) natively: the SIMD code is mapped directly to ARM NEON
intrinsics, with no emulation layer or external dependency.

## Building with CMake

You need cmake. On most linux distributions, you can simply do the following:

      git clone https://github.com/lemire/FastPFor.git
      cd FastPFor
      cmake -B build
      cmake --build build
      ctest --test-dir build

It may be necessary to set the CXX variable. The project is installable (`make install` works).

To create project files for Microsoft Visual Studio, it might be useful to target 64-bit Windows (e.g., see http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/generator/Visual%20Studio%2012%202013.html).

### CMake Options

#### FASTPFOR_SIMD_MODE

Controls how SIMD instructions are compiled. This affects portability and performance:

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `portable` | `-msse4.2` | **Default.** Compiles with SSE4.2 baseline only. Binaries will run on any x86-64 CPU from ~2008 onwards. Best for distributable libraries and CI builds. |
| `native` | `-march=native` | Compiles with all SIMD instructions supported by the build machine (may include AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, etc.). Maximum performance but binaries may crash with `SIGILL` on CPUs that lack the required instructions. |
| `runtime` | `-msse4.2` + `FASTPFOR_RUNTIME_DISPATCH` | Experimental. Intended for future runtime CPU dispatch using function multi-versioning. |

**Usage:**

```bash
# Portable build (default) - safe for distribution
cmake -B build -DFASTPFOR_SIMD_MODE=portable

# Native build - maximum performance on build machine
cmake -B build -DFASTPFOR_SIMD_MODE=native

# Check which mode is active in CMake output
cmake -B build
# Look for: "FASTPFOR_SIMD_MODE: portable" in the output
```

**When to use each mode:**

- Use `portable` (default) when building binaries that will run on different machines, in CI/CD pipelines, or when distributing pre-built libraries.
- Use `native` when building for a specific machine where maximum performance is needed and you know the binary won't be moved to a different CPU.

#### FASTPFOR_SANITIZE

Enable address sanitizer for debugging memory issues:

```bash
cmake -B build -DFASTPFOR_SANITIZE=ON
```

#### FASTPFOR_WITH_TEST

Build with Google Test (enabled by default):

```bash
cmake -B build -DFASTPFOR_WITH_TEST=OFF  # Disable tests
```

### Multithreaded context

You should not assume that our objects are thread safe.
If you have several threads, each thread should have its own IntegerCODEC
objects to ensure that there is no concurrency problems.


## Why C++11?

With minor changes, all schemes will compile fine under
compilers that do not support C++11. And porting the code
to C should not be a challenge.

In any case, we already support 3 major C++ compilers so portability
is not a major issue.

## What if I prefer Java?

Many schemes cannot be efficiently ported to Java. However
some have been. Please see:

https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR

## What if I prefer C#?

See CSharpFastPFOR: A C#  integer compression library  https://github.com/Genbox/CSharpFastPFOR

## What if I prefer Go?

See  Encoding: Integer Compression Libraries for Go https://github.com/zhenjl/encoding

## Testing

If you used CMake to generate the build files, the `check` target will
run the unit tests. For example , if you generated Unix Makefiles

    ctest --test-dir build

will do it. 

## Simple benchmark

    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build
    ./build/codecs --clusterdynamic
    ./build/codecs --uniformdynamic

## Optional : Snappy

Typing "make allallall" will install some testing binaries that depend
on Google Snappy. If you want to build these, you need to install
Google snappy. You can do so on a recent ubuntu machine as:

    sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev

## Processing data files

You can use it to process arrays on (sorted!) integers
on disk using the following 32-bit format: 1 unsigned 32-bit
integer  indicating array length followed by the corresponding
number of 32-bit integer. Repeat.

 ( It is assumed that the integers are sorted.)


Once you have such a binary file somefilename you can
process it with our inmemorybenchmark:

    ./inmemorybenchmark --minlength 10000 somefilename

The "minlength" flag skips short arrays. (Warning: timings over
short arrays are unreliable.)


## I used your code and I get segmentation faults

Our code is thoroughly tested.

Some experimental schemes can overwrite in the receiving buffer (deliberately). 
These includes Simple 9 and Simple 16 (which we recovered from the inventor's
implementations). These limitations could be fixed (pull request invited).

One common issue is that people do not provide large enough buffers.
Some schemes can have such small compression rates that the compressed data
generated will be much larger than the input data.

## Is any of this code subject to patents?

I (D. Lemire) did not patent anything.

However, we implemented varint-G8UI which was patented by its authors. 
DO NOT use varint-G8UI if you want to avoid patents.

The rest of the library *should be* patent-free.
